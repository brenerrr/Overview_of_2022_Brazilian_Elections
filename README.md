# Overview of 2022 Brazilian Elections

This project consits of analyzing the electoral data from the 2022 Brazilian election. More specifically, data from each ballot is gathered and processed from official government sources. A few questions like “What changed from the previous election (2018)?” or “How spatially concentrated are voters?” are some of the questions I wished to answer.  In order to achieve this in a more compelling way, I created an interactive dashboard with Dash.
